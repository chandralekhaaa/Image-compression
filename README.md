# Image compression

Project Description
<br/>K-means clustering was used to compress images

K-means clustering
<br/>K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

Implementation steps
<ol>
<li>Loading the image</li>
<li>Clustering the image using K-means</li>
<li>Compressing the image</li>
<li>Computing the compression ratio</li>
<li>Performing the above steps for different values of k - 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20</li>
</ol>
